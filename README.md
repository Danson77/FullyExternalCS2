### Description
-I made Gold out of this free source..... but.....

-Gad Damm BOMB TIMER!!!!!
-Try fixing it if you dare!!!!

-Only one person managed to make it work, but his code, ofcourse is as gentle as mine, so I can't implement it, but thanks to the Russian guy for some visual updates and actually fixing the timer for the bomb, yet it's still unknown for me how to implement it so the time it shows is right instead of some float starting point

### Features
-At this point, it's a brand new program. The foundation allowed me to make lots of VAC-proof features that work aggressively in the field, but keep small random adjustments for human-like foolishness of the system

-I made sure it has no visual glitches, focus loss, or  black screen while hooking up to the game

-Ton of features:
Rewrote Triger bot to the point I'm stuck, where it will trigger sometimes when a friend or prop is in the way, since I'm using Capsuls to create safety areas around friends

Aim bot is out of space, made it VAC proof since now it checks gameplay integrity, I had to implement random small overshoots and imperfect swing towards targets, which was after I totally re-wrote the aimbot since it was based on mouse button fire down, which is like LOL

RADAR that goes over your current game radar, make sure it's zoomed out to max so you can see the whole map in your game settings, then size should be 1.0, so everything is adjustable

BETTER ESP and Tactical Information and Nice Aim Crosshair

ANTI FLASH OVERLAYER - Can't remove flash totally since that would be writing to game data, which I'm not a fan of since VAC is a good b***h

-Trying to implement Auto Duck when someone looks at you, it's supposed to prevent being taped and dodge the bullet by ducking, but it works like shii
Other Features are also implemented, but I just removed them, put them in the NEW folder, commented them out and focused on the main stuff

- [Bomb timer](https://streamable.com/ylouzc) Still not showing the right time, but at least shows the  right bomb site, and if defusing... kind of....

I don't like the idea of having to configure my mouse and keyboard for it to work, so I just left it off
- OBS Bypass
- Hitsound (**_in the same folder with the cheat, there should be a file called "hit.wav"_**)
- Basic Config with hotkeys. (If you want to change the default keys, watch the link and replace the keycode with whatever u
